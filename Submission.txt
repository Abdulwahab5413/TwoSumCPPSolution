How long did you spend on this assignment?
- Approximately 1 and half hour.

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
- A

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
- A

What doesn't work in your solution?
- The solution works for all given test cases and satisfies the problem constraints.

Explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem:
- I used a hash map to efficiently store and look up indices of numbers. The complement of each number was calculated and checked in the map to find a match. The implementation focuses on time efficiency (O(n) complexity).

Where did you feel you struggled?
- Initially, understanding the hash map approach was a bit challenging, but after revisiting its use in problem-solving, it became clear.
